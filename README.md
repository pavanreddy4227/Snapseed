# Snapseed - The best app which can make you Smarter and Stylish

## About:
- Snapseed is a photo-editing application produced by Nik Software, owned by Google, available for both iOS and Android, which enables users to enhance photos and apply "Digital and High-Dimensional" filters.

- **Snapseed** users can edit pictures using swiping gestures to select different effects and enhancements. Alternatively, users can opt for an "automatic" adjustment of color and contrast. Snapseed can save users editing history and redirect to any of the actions before.

Few basic features you can find in any editing app like Crop, Rotate, Straighten, Tilt and so many. Snapseed filters are really stunning which you can't find in any other app.

**Note**: One special and important feature in Snapseed is "Picture's resolution will not be reduced, even after editing the picture. Pixels will not be reduced/merged unless until you apply so many filters.
